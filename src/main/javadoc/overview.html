Fluent JDBC is a lightweight fa√ßade for performing SQL using JDBC with a
fluent API based on the Builder and Command Object patterns.
<p>
Fluent JDBC project focuses on the subset of JDBC features
needed to perform tasks like database migration (e.g. using
<a href="http://flywaydb.org">Flyway</a>) and data loading. The assumption here
is that you're going to be using JPA for most of your interaction with the
database, but you need to do a little plain old SQL here and there and
want that to be as simple to do as possible.
<p>
Fluent JDBC is lightweight and depends only on the JDBC features of the
JDK &mdash; i.e. using Fluent JDBC requires only a single (and small) JAR
file dependency in your application.
