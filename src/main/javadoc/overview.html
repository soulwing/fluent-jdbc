A lightweight facade for performing SQL using JDBC, inspired by Spring's
<code>JdbcTemplate</code>.
<p>
Spring's <code>JdbcTemplate</code> is great... if you're using the Spring
framework. However, if you're building apps based on Java EE 7, using
<code>JdbcTemplate</code> brings in an awful lot of Spring machinery that you
don't really need.  This project focuses on the subset of JDBC features
needed to perform tasks like database migration (e.g. using
<a href="http://flywaydb.org">Flyway</a>) and data loading. The assumption here
is that you're going to be using JPA for most of your interaction with the
database, but you need to do a little plain old SQL here and there and
want that to be as simple to do as possible.
<p>
Fluent JDBC is lightweight and depends only on the JDBC features of the
JDK &mdash; i.e. using Fluent JDBC requires only a single (and small) JAR
file dependency in your application.
